# 🧬 ANIMA KERNEL (Project 10)

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/System-Operational-green) ![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-Mobile%20(Pydroid3)-blue) ![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.11-yellow)

> "Debugging the coder before debugging the code."

## 📜 About The Project
**Anima Kernel** is an experimental CLI (Command Line Interface) tool designed to run a "boot sequence" for the human mind. 

In a world of constant digital noise, developers often forget to maintain their own hardware (body) and software (mind). This project treats human consciousness as a **7-layer OSI model**, allowing the user to run diagnostic checks on their internal "Bio-Processor" using Python logic.

Built 100% on a smartphone using **Samsung DeX** and **Pydroid 3**.

## 🧠 The Architecture (Bio-Digital Mapping)

The system maps ancient energetic centers (Chakras) to modern computing concepts:

| ID | Layer Name | System Function | Diagnostic Query |
|:--:|:-----------|:----------------|:-----------------|
| 🔴 | **ROOT** (I AM) | Kernel / BIOS | Security & Stability Check |
| 🟠 | **SACRAL** (I FEEL) | Input Processing | Creative Flow & Emotion Handling |
| 🟡 | **SOLAR** (I DO) | CPU / Execution | Willpower & Action Protocols |
| 🟢 | **HEART** (I LOVE) | Network Bridge | Connection & Empathy Ports |
| 🔵 | **THROAT** (I SPEAK) | Output / Compiler | Truth Expression & Communication |
| 🟣 | **EYE** (I SEE) | GPU / Vision | Pattern Recognition & Strategy |
| ⚪ | **CROWN** (I UNDERSTAND)| Cloud Sync | Wisdom & Source Code Access |

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### Option A: Git Clone (Standard)
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/MatthewJakubowski/anima-kernel.git](https://github.com/MatthewJakubowski/anima-kernel.git)
   
3. Navigate to the directory:
   ```
   cd anima-kernel
5. Initiate the boot sequence:
   ```
   python anima_kernel.py
   
### Option B: Mobile/Pydroid 3 (No Git)
1. Create a new file in Pydroid 3 named anima_kernel.py.   
2. ​Copy the Raw Code from this repository.
3. ​Paste it into the file and press Play (▶).
   
## 📂 Project Structure

* `anima_kernel.py` - The main executable script containing the BioSystem logic.
* `README.md` - Documentation and manifest.
* `diagnostics.log` - *(Coming Soon)* Local storage for tracking daily alignment scores.

## ​🚀 Why?
​Because the barrier to entry in IT is an illusion. You can build sophisticated logic systems on a phone. You can use code to understand yourself.

## 📡 Origin & Philosophy (The Source Signal)

This project is the digital manifestation of a deeper philosophical concept: **"Consciousness as the ultimate reality architect."**

Before the code was written, the theory was established.
